# pyrtf
Create simple RTF documents in Python

## Purpose
This module helps the author create RTF (Rich Text Format) documents from a Python program. It has some general purpose characteristics but I wrote this to elp me create legal pleadings in family law cases in Texas, and it shows. (E.g. classes for CaseStyle, SignatureBlock, and CertificateOfService, etc.)

## How To
The main() function in the Python code shows how to use this module.

## Who Helped Me
I leaned heavily on Google and Stackexchange, as always. I also took full advantage of these sites:

* [O'Reilly's Rich Text Tutorial ](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/rtf-pocket-guide/9781449302047/ch01.html)
* [Tony Di Bona's Helpful Tutorial](http://www.pindari.com/)

## Substantive Research
I don't want to lose these links, although they were applicable mostly to the discovery.jdbot.us site:

* [Robert K. Wise's Masterpiece on Discovery](https://www.baylor.edu/content/services/document.php/206147.pdf)
* [W. Mark Cotham's Powerful Argument on Discovery](http://www.thehoustonlawyer.com/aa_jan06/page22.htm)

If you care at all about doing discovery right, you should download and print these articles just in case their host sites disappear.
